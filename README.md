#Scope of the project.

In this repo, you can find the HTML and CSS code that was required to lift my web page. Due to this was my first project as a frontend developer, you may find some details and lines that could be improved.

The following items express my intention to design my own PBS (Personal Branding System) webpage, the structure of the project and the pending milestones to do.

Please, feel free to study and modify this project as you like, but please, donÂ´t forget to give me some credit and a start. Do not hesitate to keep in touch with me If you have any questions or comments about this project.

##Why I have to develop this?

Besides there are a lot of developing tools such as WIX or Google Sites that make easier the work of design and deploy a project, I was looking for applying my knowledge to a personal project, and build a customized site that reflects my way to think a do.

This project is in continuous growth, and I want to think it's a representation of my learning path into the tech industry.

##What do you find in this project?

Most of the project was written in HTML and CSS. There are a folder of styles (css) and graphic resources (images).  There may be some files created during the deploy in Google Firebase (I am going to ignore them all in following pushes).

##What things are pending to develop?

- Activate the form before the footer.
- Add a blog page.
- Translate the text into the language of the browser.
- Adapt the project to mobile environments.
- Uniformize the icons on the contact info.
- Update margins and paddings.
- Update fonts, colours
